Actually, properly setting the current tiddler also involves setting some variables to the names of CSS classes, as discussed in the section on the `$tiddler` widget in [[Miscellaneous Widgets]]. However, in virtually all cases you can get away with simply setting the value of the `currentTiddler` variable.

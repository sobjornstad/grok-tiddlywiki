One of the complaints we had about our [[Contact Tiddlers]] when we initially created them was that you couldn't see any of the fields on them without clicking on the //info// button. Remedy that by adding a section to the `JaneDoe` tiddler titled `Information about Jane`, containing a bulleted list or table that shows Jane's email address, phone number, family members, and manager.

type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Create a tiddler called `$:/yourname/TiddlerLinkSummary`. Make this tiddler display a simple bulleted list of all backlinks of the current tiddler. (Since we will need to make this more complex momentarily, use a `$list` widget, not a `list-links` macro.) Then make this content included at the bottom of every tiddler.

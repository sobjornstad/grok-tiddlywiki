title: Ex:NoCurrentTiddlerMatch/answer
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

At the risk of sounding ridiculous, //because it wouldn't work//. Since we're trying to match the current tiddler with `Reading`, if we matched it against the current tiddler, it would always match and we wouldn't have any conditional logic.

This may be obvious in the context of an exercise, but I've made this mistake and been puzzled numerous times, so pay attention!

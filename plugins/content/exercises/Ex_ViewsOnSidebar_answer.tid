Tag the tiddler with `$:/tags/SideBar`, then set its `list-before` field to `$:/core/ui/SideBar/Tools`, or its `list-after` field to `$:/core/ui/SideBar/Recent`.

You can find what tag to use by poking around in `$:/tags` and seeing what looks promising, or by searching for one of the other tabs (e.g., `Recent`) in the ''Shadows'' tab of Advanced Search, finding the shadow tiddler that handles that tab, and seeing what it's tagged.

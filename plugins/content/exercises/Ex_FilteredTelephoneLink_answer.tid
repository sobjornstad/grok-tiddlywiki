title: Ex:FilteredTelephoneLink/answer
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

```html
<$link to={{{ [[tel:]addsuffix{!!phone}] }}}>Call {{!!title}}</$link>
```

Or alternatively:

```html
<$link to={{{ [{!!phone}addprefix[tel:]] }}}>Call {{!!title}}</$link>
```

This suggests a general fact: most anything you can do with [[text substitution|Text Substitution]] in a macro, you can also achieve with a [[filtered transclusion|Filters and Transclusions]]. Which you choose is largely personal preference, although sometimes one might be significantly clearer and easier than the other, in which case you should probably choose that one.

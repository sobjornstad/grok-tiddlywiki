type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

No, nothing has changed! Search only looks in the physical `title` and `text` fields of the tiddler. Transcluded content is not actually part of the text field of a tiddler -- TiddlyWiki only shows it there when you look at the tiddler -- so it doesn't show up in search, either.

If you search for //the transclusion itself// -- like, the part that looks like `{{JaneDoe}}` -- then you //will// find that. (But if you type the braces into the ordinary search bar, it doesn't like funny characters. Type just `JaneDoe` and you'll find the tiddler that transcludes `JaneDoe` shows up.)

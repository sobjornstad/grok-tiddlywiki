Create and customize a new wiki for some purpose, whether it's useful for you or not. Some ideas that might get you thinking about different ways to organize data:

* A mini-encyclopedia for a topic you know a lot about.
* A recipe book.
* A place to plan a book or other large creative project.
* A catalog for your music or book collection.

Here's the obvious and straightforward way, which has the major disadvantage of silently not updating if the manager changes and perhaps making you call the wrong number at an inopportune time:

```html
Jane's manager's phone number is {{ChrisSmith!!phone}}.
```

Now for trying to make it grab the manager's name from the `manager` field on the fly. You may have been tempted to try:


```html
{{ {{!!manager}}!!phone }}
```

â€¦but unfortunately this does not work.

There are actually two separate reasons it doesn't work. First, TiddlyWiki doesn't parse other wikitext within `{{double curly braces}}`, it only looks for a tiddler name/field. Second, even if it did, it would fail for the same reason that this didn't work in an [[exercise|Ex:MacroAdjacency]] in [[Macros]]:

```html
<<wikipediaLink>>Aardvark
```

If you need a refresher, TiddlyWiki processes the contents of transclusions (of variables and macros, as we saw before, as well as of fields) separately from the surrounding content, so the result of `{{!!manager}}` (namely, `ChrisSmith`) is an entirely separate piece of wikitext to TiddlyWiki. Thus, what it would see would be three separate, unconnected pieces: `{{`, `ChrisSmith`, and `!!phone }}`.

Here's a method that works and uses only tools we've already seen. If you worked at it long enough, you might have gotten this or something similar:

```html
\define getPhone(person)
{{$person$!!phone}}
\end

Jane's manager's phone number is: <$macrocall $name="getPhone" person={{!!manager}} />
```

That said, understanding //why// this works when `{{ {{!!manager}}!!phone }}` doesn't is likely beyond your TiddlyWiki knowledge at this point, so don't feel too bad if you didn't get it. We'll see the explanation in [[Text Substitution]].

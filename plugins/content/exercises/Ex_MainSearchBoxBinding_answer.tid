The answer is the `text` field of `$:/temp/search`. The easiest way to find this answer is to type a weird word in the search box that you won't find anywhere else (e.g., `oobleckblargle`), then open up Advanced Search and search for the same word on the `System` tab. The tiddler will appear in the list.

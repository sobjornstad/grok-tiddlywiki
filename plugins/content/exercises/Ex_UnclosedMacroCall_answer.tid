Any content anywhere after the `$macrocall` tag in the tiddler disappears! This happens because the `$macrocall` widget is not a void element, so it needs to have a closing tag. In the absence of an actual closing tag, TiddlyWiki pretends there is a matching closing tag at the very end of the tiddler. However, this causes the remainder of the tiddler to be part of the content of the `$macrocall` widget, and any content in a `$macrocall` widget is completely ignored (what would go inside the expansion of a macro call, anyway?). This is a common typo, so watch out for that slash.

If any of this didn't make sense, consider reviewing the [[HTML]] section.

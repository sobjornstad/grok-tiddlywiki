Make up and create another meeting under one of the other subcategories, either `OnboardingPeople` or `OnboardingTraining`. Be sure to include at least one participant and a time as we did when we [[set up the initial meeting|Meeting Tiddlers]]. Check to make sure that it shows up in the table of contents.

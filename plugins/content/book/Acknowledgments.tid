for reviewing early copies of //Grok TiddlyWiki// and offering detailed feedback.

[[Meta:TODO]]: Recheck the list just before publication in case someone who was out steps back in.

//Grok TiddlyWiki// would not exist without [[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com]] itself; thanks to Jeremy Ruston for spending fifteen years managing that project, and to all the community members who have helped to make this open-source project what it is.

In particular, thanks to all the members of the [[TiddlyWiki forum|https://groups.google.com/g/tiddlywiki]] for helping me learn to use TiddlyWiki, and for not just putting up with but reliably answering a wide variety of impractical questions I posed while trying to understand TiddlyWiki deeply enough to write a book about it. All users of TiddlyWiki are lucky to have such a friendly and helpful resource!

Thanks to Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen for doing pioneering work on the [[mnemonic medium|https://numinous.productions/ttft/]] and [[Orbit|https://withorbit.com]], which was the inspiration for [[TakeAway|TakeAway Help]] and is worth a look for anyone who likes TakeAway. Thanks also to Damien Elmes and the [[Anki|https://apps.ankiweb.net]] community for developing the fantastic spaced-repetition tool that got me interested in spaced-repetition study back in 2010 (as well as for five years of enjoyable and meaningful part-time work during college). I hope that TakeAway serves to advance the cause of spaced-repetition use at least a little bit.

The primary text font in //Grok TiddlyWiki// is Paul Hunt's Source Sans Pro, and the monospaced font used for code examples is Raph Levien's Inconsolata. Thanks to the designers of these excellent fonts for making them available for free.

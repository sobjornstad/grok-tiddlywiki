To update an old copy of //Grok TiddlyWiki// to this version without losing your takeaway progress and other customizations, drag the following link into your wiki: <$link to="$:/plugins/sobjornstad/GrokTiddlyWiki"><$text text={{{ [[Grok TiddlyWiki version ]addsuffix{Metadata##version}] }}}/></$link>. Sections, takeaways, exercises, and any other tiddlers that you have changed will be untouched during an upgrade.

A large red banner appears that says “Recursive transclusion error in transclude widget.” (If you're in preview mode creating a new tiddler, the error won't appear until you save the tiddler under some conditions.) This is a rather cryptic error message, but if you remember what it means, the cause of the error is usually obvious once you start looking.

As we move forward into [[templates|Templates and the Current Tiddler]], you will sometimes see this error on a template -- in that case, it does not necessarily mean you did anything wrong. More to come.

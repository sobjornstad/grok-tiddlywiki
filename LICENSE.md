See the [copyright section](https://groktiddlywiki.com/read/#Copyright) of the
book for license details.

As a preview, currently the text is CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (but if you want to do
something clever with it that doesn’t quite fit into that license, please [get
in touch](https://sorenbjornstad.com/contact)). This is noted here only for
convenience – if this file contradicts the Copyright section of the book in any
way, the Copyright section governs.

Some bits in this repository belong to others and are used under license
(either MIT or 3-clause BSD).

The same license applies to the built TiddlyWiki and the source.

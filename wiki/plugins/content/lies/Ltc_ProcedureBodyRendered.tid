There's a very important exception: if the procedure call is used as the value of a widget or HTML element's attribute, TiddlyWiki doesn't render anything or substitute any variables, it uses the procedure body literally, with any transclusions -- including transclusions of the parameters of the procedure -- inside it intact. We'll explore the consequences of this later.

While almost all of the core code of TiddlyWiki is stored in tiddlers, there is a small [[component|https://tiddlywiki.com/dev/#Microkernel]] called the //microkernel// that is not. This component is needed to “bootstrap” TiddlyWiki to the point that it is capable of reading the rest of its code from tiddlers.

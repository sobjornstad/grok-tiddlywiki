TiddlyWiki does internally know how to handle more complex JSON. There is a set of filter operators such as <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/#jsonget%20Operator" class="tc-tiddlylink-external">`jsonget`</a> that you can use to work with it. However, you'll need to use filters to work with such JSON; the data tiddler syntax will not work.

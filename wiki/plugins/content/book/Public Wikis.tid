One of the best ways to learn about any system is to see examples of what others have done with it. Here are some interesting TiddlyWikis:

* [[Mosaic Muse|https://mosmu.se]]:  shameless self-promotion, but this Zettelkasten-like system should be a nice complement to this book. I have several other wikis, but this is my largest public TiddlyWiki and where I do a lot of my TiddlyWiki-assisted thinking.
* [[Interactive Historical Atlas of the Disciplines|http://atlas-disciplines.unige.ch]], a beautiful catalog of the branches of science over time.
* The [[Community page|https://tiddlywiki.com#Community]] on tiddlywiki.com lists a number of wikis.

If you have a public TiddlyWiki you'd like to see on this list, click the //send feedback// link below and send over a URL and description.

The [[TiddlyWiki Links Aggregator|https://links.tiddlywiki.com]] is a community-built collection of TiddlyWiki resources (it probably does not surprise you to learn it is built by compiling other people's TiddlyWikis into a TiddlyWiki). You should be able to find some under the [[Examples|https://links.tiddlywiki.com/topics/examples/]] tag.

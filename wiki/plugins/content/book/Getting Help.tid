The best place to get help on TiddlyWiki is the TiddlyWiki Discourse forums, [[Talk TiddlyWiki|https://talk.tiddlywiki.org]]. If you are ever not sure how to accomplish something, searching the forum is quite likely to find either a drop-in solution or the insight you need to solve the problem yourself. If you can't find anything relevant, you can start a new thread -- people are invariably welcoming and helpful.

When starting a new thread about [[a problem you're experiencing|When Things Go Wrong]], be sure to [[ask a good question|https://medium.com/@gordon_zhu/how-to-be-great-at-asking-questions-e37be04d0603]]. Not only will taking the time to write a good question show your respect for other people's time, making it more likely you get a useful response, but you'll learn more, leave a thread in the archives that will be more likely to help others in the future, and possibly even [[solve your problem while writing the question|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging]].

Besides technical questions about how to use TiddlyWiki, the forum is also a great place to discuss philosophical and practical questions about TiddlyWiki.

You also shouldn't miss:

* The [[documentation|https://tiddlywiki.com/]] (enough said)
* The [[dev wiki|https://tiddlywiki.com/dev/]], an addendum to the documentation with information on things like creating plugins and writing JavaScript modules for TiddlyWiki
* The [[TiddlyWiki Google group|https://groups.google.com/g/tiddlywiki]] was the primary forum for many years, and the archives there still contain much useful information.
* [[Standard Nomenclature|https://anthonymuscio.github.io/#Standard%20Nomenclature]], an exhaustive list of all the brackets and quotes and other mysterious syntax of [[wikitext|Wikitext]]. It's likely to be overwhelming for beginners, but once you've worked through most of this book, it may be quite helpful. It should be noted that, as of this writing, this resource hasn't been updated to include some of the newer features in 5.3.0 â€“ for instance, it doesn't list the syntax for [[parameterized field transclusions|Parameterizing Field Transclusions]]. (//Grok TiddlyWiki//'s internal [[Wikitext Reference]] is less overwhelming but lacks some of the detail available in this resource.)
* [[Those Pesky Brackets|https://pesky-brackets.tiddlyhost.com]], another resource on syntax that focuses on the functions of brackets, braces, and quotation marks. It is much more verbose and detailed than Standard Nomenclature.

title: Welcome to Grok TiddlyWiki
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Welcome to ''Grok TiddlyWiki'', the definitive TiddlyWiki learning resource! //Grok TiddlyWiki// is a textbook that helps you build a deep, lasting understanding of and proficiency with TiddlyWiki through a combination of detailed explanations, practical exercises, and [[spaced-repetition reviews|TakeAway Help]] of prompts called //takeaways//.

[[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com]] is a human-shaped tool for organizing information and taking notes. It stores and relates information in a non-linear but structured way, just like your brain, and it doesn't forget things. Maintaining a well-organized TiddlyWiki requires a modest amount of effort, and TiddlyWiki has a bit of a learning curve, but it's extremely powerful and customizable, and once you grok it, it will change the way you take notes, think about your work and your ideas, and relate to information in general.

TiddlyWiki shines at almost any task that involves organizing information and enabling creativity. People use TiddlyWiki for keeping notes at their jobs, collecting their ideas, keeping track of what they read, drafting books, building static websites, storing recipes, managing genealogical databases, planning tabletop role-playing campaigns, and much more.

To [[grok|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok]] something is to understand it on a deep level, so thoroughly that it changes you and becomes part of your identity. This word is particularly appropriate when discussing TiddlyWiki, since its method of organizing information may well change the way you understand and relate to information in general.

The TiddlyWiki project [[considers GTW|https://tiddlywiki.com/#%22Grok%20TiddlyWiki%22%20by%20Soren%20Bjornstad]] “highly recommended” for learners, and I am an active participant in the TiddlyWiki community.

!! What version is this?

|!Book version |{{Metadata##version}}|
|!TiddlyWiki version |{{Metadata##tw-version}}|

Every time I publish a new version of //Grok TiddlyWiki//, I increase the book's version number. To see what's changed in recent versions, visit [[Changes]]. You can always find the latest version at {{Metadata##project-url}}.

The TiddlyWiki version indicates which version of TiddlyWiki this version of //Grok TiddlyWiki// expects you to have; I try to keep it up to date with the newest version, but if I'm behind, it should be fine to use a newer version of TiddlyWiki than listed here. In contrast, using an older version than listed might mean some things the book tells you to do mysteriously don't work, so that's not a good idea! If you have an older version currently, you can visit the [[TiddlyWiki Upgrader|https://tiddlywiki.com/upgrade.html]] to update your wiki to the latest version.

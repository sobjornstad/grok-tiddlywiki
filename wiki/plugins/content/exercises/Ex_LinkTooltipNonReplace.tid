type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Having overridden the definition of the `$link` widget above, if we explicitly supply a `tooltip` attribute on some `$link` widget, it's now silently replaced with the description one we added. Change the behavior so that the description tooltip is only applied if one isn't already provided for the widget.

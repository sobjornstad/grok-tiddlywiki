The most obvious approach is to use a [[conditional expression|Conditional Expressions]]. In this example, we set the variable `holiday` so we don't have to write the same filter twice, but you could also use a [[function|Functions]], or simply run it twice (it won't be much slower, just uglier):

{{Sn:OrdinaryDay||MagicSnippet}}

However, a more concise approach is to use the `$list` widget with the `emptyMessage` parameter, which is rendered if the filter returns no results:

{{Sn:OrdinaryDayList||MagicSnippet}}

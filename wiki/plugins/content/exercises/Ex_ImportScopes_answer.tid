Using `\import` would bring the local procedures into the current tiddler's scope...but //everything// in the current tiddler's scope is made global by $:/tags/Global, so separating the procedures into a separate tiddler wouldn't actually achieve anything in terms of avoiding pollution.

Most serious programming languages solve this problem in an elegant way, by automatically namespacing the things you import. If you imported `SomeTiddler`'s procedures, you would say `SomeTiddler.procedurename` rather than `procedurename` to access them. Unfortunately, TiddlyWiki doesn't currently offer this -- maybe some day!

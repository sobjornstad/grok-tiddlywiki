The easiest and cleanest way uses the <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/#TranscludeWidget" class="tc-tiddlylink-external">`$transclude` widget</a> with the `index` attribute to get a property from a data tiddler:

```html
It's ''<$transclude tiddler="UsHolidays" index=<<now "0MM/0DD">> />'' today!
```

However, we didn't discuss the `transclude` widget or its `index` attribute, so it's unlikely you thought of that unless you assumed it must exist and visited the documentation (but kudos if you did, that's the right way to think about widgets)! Here's a way to accomplish this using only tools we've already seen:

```html
<$let formattedToday=<<now "0MM/0DD">>>
  It's ''<$text text={{{ [[UsHolidays]getindex<formattedToday>] }}} />'' today!
</$set>
```

(Recall that the `text` widget is needed to prevent the holiday from turning into a link with the use of triple curly braces.)

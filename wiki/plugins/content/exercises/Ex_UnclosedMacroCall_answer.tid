Any content anywhere after the first `$transclude` tag in the tiddler disappears! This happens because the `$transclude` widget is not a void element, so it needs to have a closing tag. In the absence of an actual closing tag, TiddlyWiki pretends there is a matching closing tag at the very end of the tiddler. However, this causes the remainder of the tiddler to be part of the content of the `$transclude` widget, and any content in a `$transclude` widget is rendered only if the transclusion fails for some reason (e.g., the procedure you tried to call doesn't exist). This is a common typo, so watch out for that slash.

In an [[exercise|Ex:JohnDoeSearch]] in the previous chapter, we observed that tiddlers referenced in fields did not appear in search. Now, however, in [[Ex:JaneDataTransclusion]], we transcluded the `manager` field directly into the JaneDoe tiddler. Try searching for some of the text in that field again (e.g., `ChrisSmith`). Has anything changed?

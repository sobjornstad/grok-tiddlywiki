```html
<$list filter="[all[current]addsuffix[/Picture]is[tiddler]]">
  <$image source=<<currentTiddler>> width=300/>
</$list>
```

Notice that there's no need to do [[Conditional Inclusion]] to ensure nothing is displayed if the image isn't available -- if the picture tiddler doesn't exist, there will be zero results for the filter, and the `$list` widget will never render anything.

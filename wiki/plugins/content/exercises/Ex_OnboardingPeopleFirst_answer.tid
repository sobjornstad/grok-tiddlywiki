Set `list-before` on `OnboardingPeople` to `OnboardingHr`. (Note that the appropriate value is not `HR`, even though if you did [[one of the last exercises|Ex:TocCaptions]] in the previous section, that's what shows up in the table of contents. The caption is only used for display; you still have to specify the title in all other contexts.)

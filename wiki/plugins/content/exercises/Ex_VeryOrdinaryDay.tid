The `TodaysHoliday` tiddler has a problem: if today isn't a holiday, it says “It's today!”. While true, that sounds a little silly, doesn't it? Change the tiddler so that if today is not a holiday, it instead says, “Sadly, it's a very ordinary day today.”

//Tip//: An attribute to the `$list` widget called `emptyMessage` may come in handy.

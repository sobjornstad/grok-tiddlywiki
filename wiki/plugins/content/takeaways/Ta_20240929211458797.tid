answer: Having it be a function allows it to be fully called as the attribute of a widget, since the first wikification of a function causes the entire filter expression to be evaluated. If it were a procedure, it would be passed in to the widget attribute as the literal macro call syntax `<<now ...>>`, rather than the current time.

question: Why is this potentially more useful written as a function than as a procedure?  `\function now-timestamp() [<now [UTC]YYYY0MM0DD0hh0mm0ssXXX>]`

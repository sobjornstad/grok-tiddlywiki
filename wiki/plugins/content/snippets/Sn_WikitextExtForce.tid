attachments/my_image.png

That didn't work. How about [[attachments/my_image.png]]?

Nope! Here's the right way: [ext[attachments/my_image.png]]

(Note: this last link returns a 404 error, but it's the right syntax and would work if we had actually attached an image called `my_image.png` to this wiki.)
